# Staff Management System (Java CLI) v1.0.0

A simple **Java console-based application** designed to manage staff accounts with **admin** and **employee** roles.  
This project was part of my **university group assignment**, where my contribution focused on building the staff management module.  

It includes full **CRUD operations**, role-based access control, and multiple input validations to ensure accurate data entry.
